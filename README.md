This is a simple full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing contact information. 
Built with ASP.NET Core Web API on the backend and Angular on the frontend, it allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts. 
Each contact includes a name, email, phone number, and a "favorite" flag. 
The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive experience.
